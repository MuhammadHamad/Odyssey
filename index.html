            <h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
            <p>Some of my hobbies are playing and watching soccer, coding, playing video games, traveling and listening
                to music

                I'm not really that fascinated by poetry but I do have a poem on the topic of Anxiety: Connected to the
                book "Turtles all the way down" by John Green and a Canva Presentation on Pollution, which are two very
                major issues currently in the World</p>
